<!--You only need the file name for relative links since the domain name should be the same as the site. 
i.e in the same directory. -->
<!--Absolute paths have the protol (https://domain(site name)/file name or path). -->
<!--You can add ./ before a relative path to look for a file relative to the current directory. -->
<!-- src in images can be a full path or relaative path to images you have in the directory. -->
<!-- to move to a parent directory, use ../ next to the relative path. -->
<!--In simple words, an absolute path refers to the same location in a file system relative to the root directory, whereas a 
    relative path points to a specific location in a file system relative to the current directory you are working on.-->
<!--main image formats: jpg, png, gif, svg. -->
